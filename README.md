# hashermd5 Assignment23/09 shantanu

THis program has been written to hash string using the md5 hasher.

I have declared a class which contains the methods to hash the contained string accoring to the datatype passed as an input value in hashermd5.py . This file also verifies if the input data is of the valid type and raise errors if not. 

I have created a test package containing the test_hashermd5.py which contains unit test for all possible scenarios that i could think of. 

The input data type can be given as string, dictionary, list and tuple and the validity of the code on psuedo values can be tested in checker.py
